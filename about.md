This is a daily blog of my notes as I study Nach Yomi from both a Jewish and an academic perspective. I'm using Robert Alter's [Hebrew Bible](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393292497) as my English translation and initial source of commentary on the academic perspective, and the [Koren Tanakh](https://korenpub.com/collections/english-tanakh) as my Hebrew text.

## What is Nach Yomi?

In Judaism, the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) is divided into three parts:
- The {{ 'תורה' | he: 'Torah', 'Teaching' }}, consisting of the first five books, read by Jews on Shabbat in weekly portions throughout every year: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
- The {{ 'נביאים' | he: 'Nevi’im', 'Prophets' }}, consisting of the books which record the actions of prophets: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi – grouped together as one book in Judaism).
- The {{ 'כתובים' | he: 'Ketuvim', 'Writings' }}, consisting of three sub-parts:
  - The {{ 'ספרי אמת' | he: 'Sifrei Emet', 'Books of Truth' }}, each of which is written more or less entirely in verse: Psalms, Proverbs, and Job.
  - The {{ 'חמש מגילות' | he: 'Chamesh Megillot', 'Five Scrolls' }}, each of which is read on a specific Jewish festival: Song of Songs (on Passover), Ruth (on Shavuot), Lamentations (on Tisha B’Av), Ecclesiastes (on Sukkot), and Esther (on Purim).
  - The remaining books: Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah (grouped together as one book in Judaism), and Chronicles.

Jews use the acronym {{ 'תנ״ך' | he: 'Tanakh' }} to refer to the totality, and the acronym {{ 'נ״ך' | he: 'Nach' }} to refer to just the latter two parts. Of the books not part of the Torah or the Five Megillot, only selected passages (if that) are ever read by the average Jew in traditional religious practice. If you're curious exactly which passages that includes, I made [an interactive visualization](https://www.yacavone.net/tanakh/).

To fill this gap, {{ 'נ״ך יומי' | he: 'Nach Yomi', 'Daily Nach' }} is the synchronized daily study of one chapter of {{ 'נ״ך' | he: 'Nach' }} a day – taking about two years and two weeks to complete. It was started [in 2007 by the Orthodox Union](https://www.ou.org/news/first_it_was_daf_yomi_now_its_nach_yomi_ou_webcast_of_a_biblical_cycle_to_b/). Details about the ongoing 2024 Nach Yomi cycle can be found [on the OU website](https://outorah.org/p/183910/).
