enTitle: Connection to Psalm 114

- This event is referenced in Psalm 114 (sung during festivals and Pesach) as the Jordan turning back
- Never knew what that part of the song was referring to! I always just thought it was for dramatic effect, as in when the sea of reeds parted so too did the Jordan.

- *Honorable mention:* The pattern of “When your children ask you ‘X,’ say to them: ‘X happened because of what God did for *us* when *we* did Y’” is exactly the same as the multiple passages in Exodus that we recite during the Passover Seder
