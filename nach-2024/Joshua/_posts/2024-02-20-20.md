enTitle: Making Laws with Compassion
---

- In this chapter the law ({{ 'Numbers 35:11–28' | sefaria }}) which mandates towns of asylum is realized, with specific towns in the newly divided land being designated for this purpose.
- I have always deeply resonated with this law. To me, it demonstrates how to govern in a way which shows compassion for all.

- The commandment could have just been: “do not take vengeance into your own hands, instead you must let the accused to be tried before your community.” Instead, God recognizes the reality of an angry, bereaved person, and that in their grief they may ignore the law – creating even more injustice in the world, which the avenger may regret once their rage has passed.
- So instead of simply declaring what ought not to be done, God creates a law which explicitly recognizes the above reality by creating a way for an accused to flee an avenger while pending trial – thus, showing compassion to both the accused and the avenger. The former, since creating a way to escape may save their life, and the latter, since it prevents them from making a decision which they will regret.
