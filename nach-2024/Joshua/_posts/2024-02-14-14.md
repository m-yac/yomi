enTitle: Caleb's Return; Joshua vs. <i>Moshe</i>
---
- I was very surprised to see Caleb return! At least in the *Torah*, which I am most familiar with, it feels like it’s quite rare for a speaking character to return years later and speak again (i.e. and not just get mentioned in passing).

- I returned to Numbers to remind myself of his history, and was struck by two things. First, the only other spy that did not fear the new land was Joshua himself (I had completely forgotten he was a spy at all, not to mention the fact that he also attested Caleb’s account). Makes this 45-year reunion within the spotlight of the text even more compelling to me. The second, was the much more intimate relationship with God that the *Torah* has than the book of Joshua so far. God speaks far more often, and in a much more of a “fatherly” way, as opposed to a more “kingly” or “commander-ly” way, I suppose. *Moshe* even debates with Him in a respectful, but real, way – far different to the more transactional commander-officer relationship Joshua seems to have. I know this is because of *Moshe*’s unique relationship with God among the prophets, but it was an element that until now I didn’t realize I was missing.
