- The verb {{ 'גלל' | he: 'galal', 'roll' }} is clearly related the name of where they are standing: {{ 'גִלְגַל' | he: 'Gilgal' }}, which is standard derivation of the word {{ 'גַלְגַל' | he: 'galgal', 'wheel' }}. However it is also etymologically linked to two other words potentially relevant to the story of placing twelve stones in the river Jordan: {{ 'גַל' | he: 'gal', 'wave' }} and {{ 'מעגל' | he: 'ma‘agal', 'circle' }}, since perhaps the stones were arranged in a circle
- Regardless, this word choice is clearly meant to evoke the actions they have just taken as part of this blessing.

- *Honorable mention:* {{ 'Joshua 5:12' | sefaria }}: {{ 'וַיִּשְׁבֹּ֨ת הַמָּ֜ן' | he: 'vayishbot haman', 'and the manna stopped' }} uses the same root {{ 'ש-ב-ת' | he: 'sh-b-t' }} as Shabbat presumably because the Israelites were resting for Pesach (yes, most festival days are also literally “Shabbats” – days of rest)
