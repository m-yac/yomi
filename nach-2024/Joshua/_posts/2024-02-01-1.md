- Said earlier word-for-word at 1:7, and at 1:6 and 1:9 without the first word
- Nice rhyming to reinforce the last three words of the first chapter

<!--more-->
- *Honorable mention:* explicitly calling out the Book of Deuteronomy in 1:8 as “this book of teaching” – seems out of place given that it was just something Moses said at the time
