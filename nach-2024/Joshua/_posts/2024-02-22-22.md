- The word {{ 'מעל' | he: 'ma‘al' }}, used as both a noun and a verb here, is not one of the usual Hebrew words which are translated into English as “sin,” “trespass,” or “violation.”
- Instead, this word is only used to refer to violations against God (see: [The Concept of Ma‘al in the Bible and the Ancient near East](https://www.jstor.org/stable/599826), by Jacob Milgrom). Furthermore, from what I can tell, is almost always used in this reduplicated form where the same word is used as both a noun and an adjective.
- I really like this reduplicative idiom. To me, it successfully conveys both that there is a violation irrespective of the circumstances (the noun), and that you (or whoever the subject is) have committed a violation (the verb). Against God, both of these things are very bad – and so both should be explicitly highlighted.

- *Honorable mention:* The phrase {{ 'מה־המעל' | he: 'mah hama‘al', 'what is the sin'}} is also very poetic! The word {{ 'מה' | he: 'mah', 'what'}} is first said forward, and then said backwards as the start of the word {{ 'המעל' | he: 'hama‘al', 'the sin'}}.
