enTitle: Extra Verses, and a Wrong Consensus?
---

- Robert Alter, my [Koren](https://korenpub.com/) Hebrew Tanakh, the [OU](https://outorah.org/p/183910/)’s daily Nach Yomi email, and [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/texts) (which hosts an online Hebrew/English Tanakh) all mention the fact that in some editions, there are two extra verses after {{ 'Joshua 21:36' | sefaria }}.
- The Jewish consensus (as OU claims, and indeed all of my sources listed above follow) is that these verses are not part of Joshua, and are instead accidental duplications of a part of the parallel passage in Chronicles, specifically {{ 'I Chronicles 6:63-64' | sefaria }}.
- However, there seems to be a good argument for their *omission* instead being the accident, summarized from [this stackoverflow post](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/a/26222):

  1. The verses are present in older manuscripts and omitted in newer
  2. The omitted verses begin with the same words as the start of the verse after them and end with the same words as the end of the verse before them (making them easy to miss if you’re checking verses by their starts and ends)
  3. And, most convincingly to me, the number of towns don’t add up to 48 without these verses!!!
- I’m curious if Christian bibles have these verses, since my understanding is that most Christian bibles are based on the Septuagint – a Greek translation which predates the oldest surviving Hebrew manuscript.
- Regardless, a good reminder that chapter and verse numbers are a very modern invention! For most of this text’s history, there were no numbers to guide scribes or scholars – books, sections, and verses were referred to by (and remembered by!) the words which start them. It’s amazing there aren’t more discrepancies like this, given how similar so many of the verses are in sections like these.
