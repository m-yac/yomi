- This is the same as the Arabic word “haram,” used my Muslims to refer to banned foods or actions (the equivalent concept in Judaism being food or actions which are not kosher).
- Notable is the similarity between this word and {{ 'חָרֶב' | he: 'charev', 'sword' }} – these words bookend {{ 'Joshua 6:21' | sefaria }}: {{ 'וַֽיַּחֲרִ֙ימוּ֙ … לְפִי־חָֽרֶב׃' | he: 'vayacharimu … l’fi charev', 'And they banned … by the edge of the sword' }}. For me, this juxtaposition helped explain the meaning of the former word, since before this verse I had no idea what exactly “being banned” meant.

- This is a horrible thing to read. In the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict I know that right-wing Israeli politicians and generals have been using a lot of biblical language and stories to justify their actions in Palestine, and so I was expecting to read things like this. But it’s just horrible, and makes me mad that there are things in this holy book which give hateful people ammo for justifying acts of cruel violence.
