enTitle: A Deuteronomy-Style Speech
---

- This is a very Deuteronomy-style speech. I find it very easy to read in Hebrew, it is spoken in extremely clear and simple language!
- Not just the dialogue, but the formula of stating what you are commanded to do followed by a forecasting of the good that will come if you follow and the bad that will come if you stray is very Deuteronomy.
