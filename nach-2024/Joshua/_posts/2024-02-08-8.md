- I’m quite accustomed to commands beginning with an imperative {{ 'שמע' | he: 'sh’ma', 'listen!' }} or an exclamatory {{ 'הנה' | he: 'hineh', 'here!' }}, so the command in {{ 'Joshua 8:1' | sefaria }} beginning with an imperative {{ 'רְאֵה' | he: 'r’eh', 'see!' }} feels very deliberately chosen to me.
- This command begins God’s commands to Joshua. Later in the same command, and in 8:4 and 8:8 the same is used to begin and end Joshua’s commands to his soldiers.
- Given how incredibly specially-oriented the text discussing this battle is, I’m not surprised “see” is the operative word here. God is having Joshua lead a very delicately choreographed maneuver, everyone will need to have their eyes wide open for it to go off without a hitch.
