- I love that the final portion of land, given to Joshua, is explicitly given by the Children of *Yisrael*. Even though everyone knew he was going to get it, and the Children of *Yisrael* don’t really have the authority to give it (Joshua does), it it still the Children of *Yisrael*, not Joshua, who apportion this land.
