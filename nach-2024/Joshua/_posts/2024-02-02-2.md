- Three words in a row with the same root, {{ 'ע-ל-ה' | he: 'ʻa-l-h' }} meaning “up” or “on”
- The story has been very focused, stating precisely what is happening, and sprinkled in are these sections which are beautiful to say!

- *Honorable mention:* Direct quote from song of the sea in 2:9 – so obviously out of place vocabulary-wise to the rest of what she’s saying


- *Honorable mention:* There is a y’tiv (most emphatic and dramatic cantillation mark) on the {{ 'אִם' | he: 'im', 'if' }} of 2:14 (“… if you do not tell…”)


- *Question:* What is the best way to translate {{ 'אישה זונה' | he: 'isha zonah' }}, literally “adultering woman” or “promiscuous woman”, from 2:1? It’s a well established phrase meaning “woman sex worker,” but because the verb {{ 'זונה' | he }} itself is so broad, in general this could be a reductive translation. In this case, it seems that this term is not used to pass moral judgement on her, and merely just to accurate described her occupation. But, still, what word to use? A direct but potentially offensive word because the Hebrew itself uses a rude word, or a kinder more modern word as to not be rude?
