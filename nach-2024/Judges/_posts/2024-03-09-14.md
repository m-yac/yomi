- As I first noticed with Lot’s wife turning into a pillar of salt, the text seems uncomfortable with the more mystical/magical/folkloric elements of these stories, as it glosses over them very quickly with little detail provided. In this case, there is suddenly a lion, he killed it, suddenly there’s honey, he takes from it, and the story moves on. No discussion of how he felt about it, no dialog, no thoughts, or even any real detail about how either of the events actually went down.

- It really makes me wonder if the editors would have removed such details from these story if he could without having other, more essential, parts of the stories not make sense. If that’s true, what other mystical elements got cut out of these stories when they made the transition from being oral to being written? And it makes even more fascinating their inclusion when they seem to be so contrary to editors’ personal beliefs about how God interacts with the world.
