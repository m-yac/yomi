enTitle: Samson's Mother

- A continuation of the theme of women featuring key roles in the stories of this book! In this case, it’s Samson’s mother.
- First, she and only she receives the specific instruction that her son’s hair is not to be cut. This is normal for nazarites, but as Alter mentions, it’s notable that it’s told to her during her initial encounter with the angel, and it is never mentioned again – neither in hers nor the angel’s repeat of the message.
- Second, the angel only appears to her. Although the second time, she does go and gets her husband and the angel stays, the angel seems annoyed at having to repeat himself unnecessarily.

- *Honorable mention:* As Alter points out, the word {{ 'אישה' | he: 'ishah' }} appears repeatedly in this chapter – both with its colloquial meaning as “wife” and with its literal meaning of “woman.” As Alter claims, and I’m excited to find out, this coming story will center on women.
