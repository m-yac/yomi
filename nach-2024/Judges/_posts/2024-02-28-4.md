enTitle: <i>Mitzvah</i> of Dignity?
---

- I’d like to think that *Ya’el* giving *Sisera* a blanket, milk (instead of just water), and making him comfortable is her showing him kindness in spite of what she has resolved herself to do. I like to think this because this is how I hope I would act in such a situation, if I ever overcame my own pacifism enough to  do anything even remotely like this. I think that everyone deserves kindness, even if it has been decided that they are to be punished, which in and of itself is not a kindness.
- However, this is more likely just her lulling him into a false sense of security so he lets his guard down. I’d still like to take away from this, though, the lesson that no matter what, giving others dignity is a mitzvah.
