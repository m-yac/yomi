- Striking to me in this final narrative of Judges is the near-total absence of God as an active member of the story. Only in these three brief (the second of which is made up of just two two-syllable words!) answers to the Israelites pre-battle questions does the text record any dialog from God – and aside from these “official” queries, the Israelites seem to have no interest in asking God to weigh in on their actions on a personal level.

- Another observation I made, which I feel is connected to this, is that in chapter 19, the text does not seem to record any character's emotions or thought processes.
- Beyond the common observation that the Levite man somehow doesn't notice that his concubine is dead, the text doesn't record the man noticing or feeling *anything* – it simply has him silently proceed to chopping her up.
- I'm not sure exactly what this represents. I can think of two options:
  1. Perhaps it is indicative of just how far the Israelites have fallen: that emotions and contemplations and dialog with God are absent from their lives outside of official acts.
  2. Perhaps it is another instance of what I observed in [my notes on Judges 14]({% post_url nach-2024/Judges/2024-03-09-14 %}): the text being so uncomfortable with the content of the story (*very* believable in this case) that the editor moves straight past the aspects that would make it feel more “real” – emotions, contemplations, and dialog with God.
