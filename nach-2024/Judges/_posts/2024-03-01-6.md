- This is God’s response to Gideon asking why, if *Adonai* is with them, He has not saved them from *Midyan*.
- What an incredible, tough-love response to a crisis of faith. Responding to a question of “Why haven’t you fixed this?” with “Why do you think I put you here? *You* fix it – I know you’re strong enough.”

- I am going to try to listen, and see if I hear {{ 'לך בכוחך הלא שלחתיך' | he }} (“Go with your strength, have I not sent you?”) about anything in my own life. I hope that if I hear it, I can listen. Though, it is some relief that even with a literal messenger of *Adonai* standing in front of him, it still takes Gideon three additional tests (one with the messenger, two with the wool on the threshing floor) in order for him to fully trust and believe in this message.
