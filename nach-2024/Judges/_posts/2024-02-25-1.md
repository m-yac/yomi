- I read Alter’s introduction and I love his characterization of this book as the “wild west.” The events of this book occur in a time without any regional government, where the norm in the land is that each person does what they want by way of violence – both traits shared by the “wild west” in American folkloric history.
- This verse, where Judah cuts off the thumbs and big toes of a local ruler and he responds by acknowledging that he has done the same to 70 other kings, and now God is replaying him for that, I expect to be emblematic of what’s to come: a time where acts of individual violence are the norm in the face of anarchy.

- *Honorable mention:* What most immediately struck me about this book when reading along in Hebrew is how different the writing style is from Joshua. Where Joshua uses quite flowery and dramatic language (even during the more simply-spoken Deuteronomy-style speeches), this text (so far) speaks extremely plainly, tersely, and with a very elementary vocabulary (i.e. one that I can understand without looking up, or even thinking twice about, a single word!). {{ 'Judges 1:1-3' | sefaria }} exemplify this for me.
