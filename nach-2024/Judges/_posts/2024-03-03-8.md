- {{ 'מְשֹׁל' | he: 'm’shol' }} is the command “(you) rule” – perhaps even accurately translated as “you must rule.” This is demand, not an ask. If it were the latter, the verb would not be the imperative מְשֹׁל but the jussive {{ 'תִמְשֹׁל' | he: 'timshol', 'may you rule' }} – or be paired with {{ 'נא' | he: 'na', 'please' }}.
- {{ 'גם' | he: 'gam', 'also' }} is repeated multiple times in short bursts, making this sentence sound even more desperate.
- {{ 'מִיַד מִדְיָן' | he: 'miyad midyan', 'from the hand of Midyan' }} is a beautiful alliterative phrase in Hebrew – aside from its brevity, out of place in an otherwise rushed and desperate sentence.

- In contrast, Gideon’s reply is as spelled out and measured as possible. He includes the pronoun {{ 'אני' | he: 'ani', 'I' }} even though it’s implicit in the conjugation {{ 'אמשל' | he: 'emshol', '(I) will rule' }}, which both reenforces his personal rejection of their command, and makes the two first parts of his reply match perfectly in number of words (i.e. matching “I/myself” with “my son”).
- All together, their terse and forceful command paints the Israelites as desperate, and his precise and measured response paints Gideon as unfazed in the certainty of his refusal.

- *Question:* The phrase “Adonai will rule over you” obviously resonates with me, as a modern day Jew, but this book seems to be pro-monarchy, or at the very least, actively trying to contrast this period of violence and instability with a presumed period of future stability during the monarchy. It makes me wonder about this era of monarchy to come – is it liked? was it successful? what caused it to end? It makes me wonder what the person compiling this book thought about this response of Gideon. Did they think he was foolish to think this Israelites *would* submit to Adonai as their ruler? It seems like maybe so, since they have no response to this statement of Gideon’s, and instead immediately revert to idol worship. Or did they think he had the right idea, and the Israelites just weren’t ready.
