enTitle: Reversal of the Ark's Role
---

- Unlike in past conflicts, the result of the Israelites using the divine powers of the ark is not a victory, but a defeat. In fact, it is perhaps the divine power of the ark that emboldens the Philistines and enables them to have such a complete victory.
- To me, this indicates that perhaps this defeat is God's work. Most battles written about so far seem to explicitly have God's intervention as the reason for victory or defeat, rather than military might or strategy. Perhaps the result of the ark's power being a rallying of the Philistines, rather than a scattering of them as in most other cases, is the text's way of indicating that the outcome of this battle was decided by God to be an Israelite defeat.

- This is further strengthened by the fact that Eli's sons also die in this battle – punishment that God has already prophesied.
- The question is then why would God cause the Israelites to loose in this way? Beyond enacting vengeance on Eli's line, it is presumably to ensure that the events that will come in the rest of this book will surely happen. I'm assuming that includes the establishment of the monarchy, but beyond that I'll have to see!

- *Honorable mention:* I never put it together, but the name {{ 'איכבוד' | he: 'Ichavod', 'Ichabod' }} is just literally the phrase: {{ 'אי כבוד' | he: 'i kavod', 'no glory' }}.
