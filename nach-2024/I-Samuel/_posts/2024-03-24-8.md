- What this translation captures that Alter's (and others') do not is the double usage of the root {{ 'נ-ט-ה' | he: 'n-t-h' }}, meaning “to be tilted” or “to be inclined.” (Not relevant here, but this does include “to be inclined” in the sense of “tend”, as in: “I am inclined to agree.”)
- First, the root is used used in its simple verb form (“to be tilted”) and then in its causative verb form (“to tilt”). Translating both of these usages into  corresponding forms of the same English verb “tilt” makes it clear that it is the exact same corruption which seized them after they saw their profits (their “cut”) that they then impose onto the justice system.
- Note that I chose to translate {{ 'אחרי הבצע' | he: 'acharei habatza‘' }}, which literally means “after the cut,” as “by their cut” to make it clear what “cut” means in this context. I find this easy to excuse because the Hebrew word {{ 'אחרי' | he: 'acharei', 'after' }} is often not translated literally in English due to its idiomatic usage not always lining up with its English counterpart.

- *Honorable mention:* {{ 'I Samuel 8:22' | sefaria }}: {{ 'לְכ֖וּ אִ֥ישׁ לְעִירֽוֹ׃' | he: 'L’chu ish l‘iro'}}, meaning “Go! Every man to his town!” Such a resigned and disappointed ending! He’s basically saying “Everybody get out of here! I’m done.”
