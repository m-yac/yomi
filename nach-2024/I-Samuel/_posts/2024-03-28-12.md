- This speech is clearly the sibling of that in {{ 'I Samuel 8:11' | sefaria }}. After telling the Children of *Yisrael* the terrible things that a king will do, Samuel asks them whether he has done any of these things. When they inevitably say no, he has no direct response, and instead says essentially: “And then you all had to go and say ‘No, give us a king!’” What he is very carefully *not* saying is that  they had something good (i.e. him) but they just *had* to go and demand a king, and are now worse off by having one.
- To reinforce his own value as a prophet, and his own wisdom in knowing that a king is a bad idea, he then asks *Adonai* to bring unseasonable rain as a sign to indicate that asking for a king was a sin.

- To me, all of this is comes off as very selfish and bitter by Samuel! He is using what seesm to be framed as his final speech to talk about how great he is and undermine the new authority that the people chose over his. Being bad-mouthed and flexed on by the old authority on his way out is not a good way to start a new administration! I don’t know what’s going to happen, but by undermining the monarchy it seems like Samuel is setting the people up for failure.
