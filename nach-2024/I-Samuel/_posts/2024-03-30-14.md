- Three words in a row which are derived from the root {{ 'ע-ל-ה' | he: 'ʻa-l-h' }}, just like in [my notes on Joshua 2]({% post_url nach-2024/Joshua/2024-02-02-2 %})! Only this time, it rhymes too!

- *Honorable Mention:* Interesting theme of binary choices: first with Johnathan deciding whether to attack the Philistines and then the Urim and Thummim deciding who has the blame. I feel like there must be a some thread that also connects these two parts of the story to the honey part, but I don’t think it’s this.
