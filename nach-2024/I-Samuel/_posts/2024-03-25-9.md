enTitle: Saul Has No Agency
---

- It is very striking how much Saul does not really have agency of his own in this part of this story. He leaves because his father lost some donkeys and wants Saul to find them for him, he goes to the town where Samuel is instead of turning back because his servant convinces him to go, he is found by Samuel while trying to find Samuel himself, is given a feast, is given a place to sleep, and is woken up by Samuel. Although it hasn’t happened yet, he will also be made a divinely empowered ruler.
- All of this just sort of happens to Saul! He doesn’t seem to be really seeking any of it out, and in some cases even has to be convinced.
- I don’t know if this is meant to be a positive, negative, or neutral quality. It certainly does not paint him as a man of action, but perhaps it paints him as an everyman?
