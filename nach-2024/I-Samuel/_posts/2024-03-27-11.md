- This chapter starts quite abruptly with Nahash, who we are encountering for the first time, encamping against the tribes of Gad and Reuben. Josephus, a Jewish historian who wrote in the first century CE, provided more detail in his recap of the events of the book of Samuel ([Antiquities of the Jews, Book VI Chapter 5](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3AWorks_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/168)), but that was all we knew until the discovery of the dead sea scrolls.
- Among the scrolls was a fragment that includes extra verses at the start of this chapter! These verses not only contain what Josephus wrote, but also give a reason for Nahash's encampment in the first place. Here's a scan of the fragment:

- I had a go at transcribing and translating this fragment (mostly[^1]) myself!

- Line 1 is the end of {{ 'I Samuel 10:27' | sefaria }} but without the final two words {{ 'ויהי כמחריש' | he: 'va’y’hi k’macharish', 'and he kept his peace' }}, and line 5 (which was mistakenly omitted during the scribe's first pass and is meant to be inserted at the “//” in line 6) is the start of {{ 'I Samuel 11:1' | sefaria }} but with the three additional words {{ 'ויהי כמו חדש' | he: 'va’y’hi k’mo chadash', 'and it was about a month' }} at the start. Notice how similar these two sets of words are! The concensus is that the version here is the correct one, and the extra words at the end of 10:27 are a mangling and misplacement of the words which should start 11:1. This is backed up by the Septuagint ([I Samuel 10:27](https://biblebento.com/index.html?lxx1i&90.10.27)-[11:1 LXX](https://biblebento.com/index.html?lxx1i&90.11.1)).
- Of course, the three and a half lines in between these two are also believed to be original by scholars. Aside from providing more background on Nahash, these lines also give the reason for Nahash encamping against Jabesh-Gilead in the first place! Namely, that seven thousand of his victims fled across the Jordan and were hiding in Jabesh-Gilead.

- Doing this transcription has made much more viscerally understand how errors in the text come about! Here are two things in particular:
- First, during the copying of these very verses which are later erroneously omitted, the scribe nearly erroneously omits a verse himself – inadvertently demonstrating exactly how such errors happen! Notice how both line 5 (which was omitted on the scribe's first pass) and the first half of line 6 (which is supposed to proceed it) both end with “Jabesh-Gilead.” The idea is that while copying, the scribe unknowingly jumped from one instance of “Jabesh-Gilead” to another, accidentally skipping line 5.
- Second, so many of the letter forms in the scribal style of this period are *so* similar! Here's a comparison using the [4Q416 font from Haifa University](https://web.archive.org/web/20240123181255/https://megillot.haifa.ac.il/index.php/en/cryptic-font), which is based on the letter forms from the dead sea scrolls, and the [Keter Aram Tsova font](https://culmus.sourceforge.io/taamim/index.html), which is based on the letter forms from the Aleppo and Lenningrad codices:

- Letter pairs such as {{ 'כ' | he: 'kaf' }} / {{ 'ב' | he: 'bet' }} and {{ 'ר' | he: 'resh' }} / {{ 'ד' | he: 'dalet' }}, which are always difficult to distinguish in Hebrew block lettering due to their only difference being a serif, are almost identical in the letter forms of the dead sea scrolls.
- However its the triplet of {{ 'י' | he: 'yod' }} / {{ 'ו' | he: 'vav' }} / {{ 'ז' | he: 'zayin' }} being so similar which really surprised me. In particular, {{ 'י' | he: 'yod' }} and {{ 'ו' | he: 'vav' }} have such similar lengths (their only distinguishing element) that they appeared identical to me when transcribing. This is exacerbated by how tightly the letters are packed together, as demonstrated by the words {{ 'בני' | he: 'b’nei' }} and {{ 'עמון' | he: 'Ammon' }} – where the neighboring letters obscure the length of the supposed {{ 'י' | he: 'yod' }} or {{ 'ו' | he: 'vav' }}. I see now why scribal errors which mix these two letters up are so common!

- *Honorable Mention:* As Alter says in his comments, kingship is conferred onto Saul three times: first before *Adonai* and Samuel alone, second in a public assembly, and third after a military victory.
- To me, this is not only a way of “covering all the bases” in terms of legitimacy, but also reinforces the different spheres over which a king is expected to rule: the spiritual, the civic, and the military.

[^1]: I did end up needing help for the the final three lines, which I got from what appears to be the standard transcription and translation of this fragment: [“The Ammonite Oppression of the Tribes of Gad and Reuben: Missing Verses from 1 Samuel 11 Found in 4QSamuel<sup>a</sup>” by Frank Moore Cross](https://brill.com/edcollchap/book/9789004631618/B9789004631618_s011.xml?language=en). The bold parts of my translation are taken directly from this source. I did this whenever the Hebrew letters were either illegible to me or missing.
