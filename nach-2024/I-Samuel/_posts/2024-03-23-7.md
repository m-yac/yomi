enTitle: Samuel is Now Influential

- How did Samuel suddenly gain so much influence? I realize there is that paragraph at the end of chapter 3 ({{ 'I Samuel 3:19-21' | sefaria }}) saying that all of *Yisrael* saw him as a prophet – but how did that happen? Is he in a position of authority now, or just an influential person?
- Of course now, by the end of this chapter, Samuel is deeply rooted as *Yisrael*’s next judge after interceding with God and demonstrating a victory over the Philistines.
- This is reinforced by the fact the ending of this chapter is almost perfect: *Yisrael* has a good and active judge, the Philistines are subdued for the duration of his rule, the towns taken by the Philistines were returned, and there is peace with the Amorites.
