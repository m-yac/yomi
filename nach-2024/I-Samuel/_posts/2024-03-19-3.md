- {{ 'הנני' | he: 'hineni' }} is the word {{ 'הנה' | he: 'hineh', 'here' }} combined with the pronoun {{ 'אני' | he: 'ani', 'I' }},[^1] to mean “here I am.” This phrase is spoken repeatedly by Samuel in this chapter.
- However, {{ 'הנה' | he: 'hineh' }} means more than just “here” – it is an exclamation, often translated as “behold!” or “look!” The word {{ 'פֹּה' | he: 'po' }} means “here” in the purely descriptive sense, so to simply say “here I am” one would say {{ 'אני פה' | he: 'ani po' }}. By saying {{ 'הנני' | he: 'hineni' }} one is really saying: “Behold! It is I! Here I am!”[^2] It is a vulnerable, powerful affirmation.
- This phrase is one which has always resonated deeply with many Jews. A declaration of {{ 'הנני' | he: 'hineni' }} is one deeply associated with prophets (as it is in this chapter), and with a declaration of faith and willingness to serve.[^3]
