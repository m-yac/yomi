- The word {{ 'עברים' |he: '‘Ivrim', 'Hebrews' }} is used a few times in this chapter ({{ 'I Samuel 13:3, 7, 19' | sefaria }}) to refer to the Jewish people, instead of the more common {{ 'ישראל' | he: 'Yisra’el' }} or {{ 'בני ישראל' | he: 'B’nei Yisra’el', 'Children of <i>Yisrael</i>' }}.
- Alter notes that {{ 'עברי' | he: '‘Ivri', 'Hebrew' }} is the term neighboring groups used to refer to the Israelites in this period, and thus speculates that the use of the term here is meant to highlight the oppression of the foreign Philistines.
- Etymologically, this name is believed to come from the root {{ 'ע-ב-ר' | he: '‘a-v-r' }}, from which the verb {{ 'עָבַר' | he: '‘avar', 'cross over' }} and the adjective {{ 'עֵבֶר' | he: '‘ever', 'across' }} derive. The idea is that it evolved from a phrase like {{ 'עבר הירדן' | he: '‘ever hayarden', 'across the Jordan' }} that neighboring groups would use to refer to the Israelites.
- This commonly believed etymology appears to be referenced directly in the verse above!
