- Samuel’s repeated claim in verse 29 that God does not “regret” is quite directly shown to be false by the narrator of the text, since both before and after Samuel's claim the text specifically states the opposite!

- Furthermore, the text uses God’s true name as the subject, while Samuel only uses the title “Eternal of *Yisrael*” – further cementing the text's authority over Samuel's.

- As Alter is very excited to point out, this throws into question Samuel’s reliability. If he states a falsehood about God so confidently, what else has he gotten wrong?
- Alter conjunctures that the mistake of the selection of Saul as king may have been entirely Samuel’s doing, and not God’s – and in fact what the text has presented as God’s words to Samuel were in fact just Samuel’s delusions.
- I wouldn’t go that far, but I definitely think that Samuel is a bit power-mad, and abuses his unique connection with God as the current chosen prophet to add his own will into his pronouncement of God’s.
