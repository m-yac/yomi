enTitle: An Idolatry-Like Offering
---

- I find the actions of the Philistine priests here very interesting. They seem to recognize the power of *Adonai* and that moves them to return the ark, but they do so in a way which is characteristic of their religion â€“ i.e. they create of golden idol-like objects as part of their guilt offering.
- I also find it interesting that this offering appears to be accepted by the Levite priests and *Adonai*, despite its more pagan stylings. In fact, it is the Israelites who are subsequently punished, because they looked into the ark. The Philistines leave unscathed, apparently having made an acceptable offering.

- *Honorable mention:* As I noticed a few sources say, this chapter seems to confirm the connection to rats discussed in [my notes on Joshua 16]({% post_url nach-2024/I-Samuel/2024-03-22-6 %}).
